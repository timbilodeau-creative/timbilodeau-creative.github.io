      <h2>Timeline in Progress</h2>
      <p>I’m polishing this section. Check back soon!</p>

  <!-- First timeline item -->
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-date">Age: 3</div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Commodore 64 and BASIC</h2>
      <p>Discovered computing through my grandfather’s Commodore 64—learning BASIC commands, booting games from 5¼-inch floppy disks, and exploring every function of the console and joystick for hours on end.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Second timeline item -->
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-date">Age: 5-10</div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Windows 3.1, 95, 98 and XP</h2>
      <p>The golden era of curiosity and computers. I was always first to the family PC, diving into Flash and Java games, experimenting with programs, and smuggling DOS games to school on 3.5-inch floppy disks and early USB drives.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Third timeline item -->
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-date">Age 11-15</div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Windows XP & 7. Software and Web Dev</h2>
      <p>Excelled in PowerPoint, Word, and Excel during grades 5–6, then advanced to web development in grades 8–9, learning HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript—skills that would soon guide me toward game design</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Fourth timeline item -->
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-date">Age 15-20</div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Windows 10, Linux & Others</h2>
      <p>As my skills grew, I moved from web development into 3D art and game creation. What began with basic Blender lessons in school quickly turned into late nights experimenting on my own, uncovering Unity Engine, and learning how full game development pipelines work. That spark pushed me to take courses and join local game dev communities.</p>
